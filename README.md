### Section 1: Description  
This tutorial serves as a starting point for students who are interested in learning a bit about the analysis tools in ArcGIS Online. This web-based GIS offers many analysis tools including simple tools such as buffering and selection as well as more advanced GeoAI deep learning tools such as "extract features". 

This workshop demonstrates tools such as: Select by attributes (use feature attributes to create a subset of features), generate travel areas (to identify a 2 minute drive polygon around childcare centres), and layer enrichment (using the resulting polygons from the drive time analysis, we will enhance the associated attributes by enriching the table with demographic variables captured from Statistics Canada and Environics Analytics).

### Section 2: The Scenario  

Parents need infant child care! We’re going to assess a neighbourhood in St. Catharines for existing childcare by displaying point features, filtering, running drive time analysis and enriching the areas of interest with family and income statistics. ​The software will allow us to visualize the data in unique ways and offer a tool to identify areas of need.
